## Setting specific Rules:

- Extra attack is only available if you have at least one Extra Limb (Arm, Head, Leg, Tail, etc)
- Will and Per are **not** bound to IQ
- Luck is based on Game Time (15 CP for **Once Daily**)
- "Armor Gaps" are included
- "Damage to weapons & armor" is included
- Crippled abilities (Including the expanded rule option from "Psionic Powers" p7) will probably be used
- Most Per-Rolls are secretly done by the GM, Players **can** call for one anytime
- **ALL** aging related Traits have their RAW-cost halved
- Will + Per are tied to (IQ + HT)/2
- Fast draw is available for most items/weapons (Requires proper and believable trappings)
