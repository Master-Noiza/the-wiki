### Base Option

| Roll  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3     | Spell fails entirely. Caster takes 1d of injury                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 4     | Spell is cast on caster (if harmful) or on a random nearby foe (if beneficial)                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5-6   | Spell is cast on one of the caster’s companions (if harmful) or on a random nearby foe (if beneficial)                                                                                                                         |
| 7     | Spell affects someone or something other than its intended target friend, foe, or random object. Roll randomly or make an interesting choice                                                                                   | 
| 8     | Spell fails entirely. Caster takes 1 point of injury                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9     | Spell fails entirely. Caster is stunned (IQ roll to recover)                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10-11 | Spell produces nothing but a loud noise, bright flash of light, awful odor, etc                                                                                                                                                |
| 12    | Spell produces a weak and useless shadow of the intended effect                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13    | Spell produces the reverse of the intended effect                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 14    | Spell seems to work, but it is only a useless illusion. The GM should do his best to convince the wizard and his companions that the spell did work!                                                                           |
| 15-16 | Spell has the reverse of the intended effect, on the wrong tar get. Roll randomly                                                                                                                                              |
| 17    | Spell fails entirely. Caster temporarily forgets the spell. Make an IQ roll after a week, and again each following week, until he remembers                                                                                    |
| 18    | Spell fails entirely. A demon or other malign entity appropriate to the setting appears and attacks the caster. (The GM may waive this result if, in his opinion, caster and spell were both lily-white, pure good in intent.) |

### 2nd Option:

| Roll | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3    | Spell fails entirely. Caster takes 1d of injury                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4    | Spell is cast on caster. If it’s beneficial, then he’s also stunned (IQ-2 roll to recover)                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5    | Spell is cast on one of the caster’s companions (roll randomly). If it’s beneficial, then the target is also stunned (IQ-2 roll to recover)                                                                                                                                      |
| 6    | Spell is cast on a nearby foe (roll randomly). If it’s harmful, then the target automatically makes any HT rolls required as a result, and is filled with hatred for the caster                                                                                                  |
| 7    | The nearest tree or wooden object bursts into flower                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
| 8    | Spell is cast on something – anything – other than its intended target. Roll randomly or make an interesting choice                                                                                                                                                              |
| 9    | Spell fails entirely. Caster takes 1 point of injury                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 10   | Spell fails entirely. Caster sees a wondrous vision of a mystical otherworld, and must make an IQ roll or be mentally stunned                                                                                                                                                    |
| 11   | A brief rain of golden flowers falls on the caster, or over the target area of an Area spell                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12   | Spell produces a weak and useless shadow of the intended effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 13   | Spell produces the reverse of the intended effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14   | Spell has the reverse of the intended effect, on the wrong target (roll randomly)                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 15   | Spell fails entirely. Caster temporarily forgets the spell. Make an IQ roll after a week, and again each following week, until he remembers. Studying the spell before then is a waste of time                                                                                   |
| 16   | Spell seems to work, but this is only a useless illusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 17   | Spell fails entirely. Caster turns into a wild boar for a week                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18   | Spell fails entirely. Caster, his allies, and anyone else nearby are transported to a mystical otherworld, or an angry and powerful faerie is summoned to the scene, or caster loses a point of HT and gains a -10-point Divine Curse somehow related to the spell (GM’s option) |

### 3rd Option:

| Roll | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3    | Spell seems to work, but this is only a useless illusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4    | Spell fails entirely. Somewhere else, a “backblast” does something awful to something the caster values, proportionate to the spell’s power and intent                                                                                                                                         |
| 5    | Caster loses a point of Will, permanently                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6    | Caster loses a level of Appearance, permanently, in a manner appropriate to the spell. Create Fire might cause unsightly burn scars, while Madness may subtly unhinge the caster’s eye sockets, giving a wild, staring effect                                                                  |
| 7    | Spell is cast on loved ones, friends, allies, innocent bystanders, or the caster (in that order) if harmful, or on foes if beneficial                                                                                                                                                          | 
| 8    | Spell fails entirely. Caster takes 2 points of injury, and the wound immediately becomes infected (see Infection, p. B444)                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9    | Caster must make a Fright Check at -5 as horrific visions of the afterlife of the damned fill his eyes                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 15   | Spell creates vermin – rat, giant cockroach, immense tapeworm, etc. – inside the caster (stomach, throat, etc.). Depending on the nature and location of the vermin, this may cause severe injuries, probably at least 2d. At minimum, it will be very bad for the caster’s medium-term health |

| 18   | Spell fails entirely. A demon, different from any demon with whom the caster has dealings, appears and attempts to wreak havoc – attacking the caster if he gets in the way. The caster may use black/demonic magic to fight it; there’s little honor or fellowfeeling among such creatures    |

| 14    | Spell appears to work, but the effects seem to have a mind of their own.

| 18    | Spell produces an apparently completely real effect, without doing anything useful. In fact, it’s “possessed” by an independent spirit, which renders the magic more “solid” to use it as a body, with powers appropriate to the spell’s nature. This body may resemble an elemental creature, a mass of organic matter, a floating ball of light, etc. The creature is whimsical or seemingly insane, and may be malicious toward the caster or anyone else in the vicinity. It can’t be dispelled, and is very hard to harm, as it can draw on local mana to regenerate. It will probably eventually wander off, but it will then cause trouble for everyone it meets |

| 14    | Spell appears to work. However, this is a déjà vu effect; after 2d seconds, revert to the moment of casting. The target and bystanders realize that nothing has happened, but may have a good idea what was attempted. Caster must roll IQ-2 not to proceed on the belief that the spell worked; he may retry every 3 seconds until he succeeds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15    | Spell has the reverse of the intended effect, on 1d+1 different targets (roll randomly)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 16    | Spell fails entirely. “Fortean” events ensue within 2d miles of the location over the next week – rains of frogs, minor timeslips, persistent attacks of déjà vu for anyone in the area, clocks running backward, etc. Furthermore, everyone in the area somehow knows that the caster is involved with all this. He may acquire Reputation -1 or -2 with these people for a few months as a result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17-18 | The spell works, possibly in an exaggerated or misdirected form – and the universe manifests a sapient, free-willed being of superhuman power whose purpose is to dissuade the caster from manipulating reality in dangerous or excessive ways in future. This entity may order the caster to fix some problem immediately or suffer punishment, stay around for a few months in immaterial form and intervene occasionally to change things, or simply incapacitate the caster in some way. It isn’t omnipotent or omniscient, but raw force doesn’t work against it, and it ignores magical attacks; it must be assuaged, waited out, or outwitted |

| 14    | Spell seems to work, but this is a phantom illusion created by a spirit. The spirit attempts to plant the delusion in the caster’s mind that he succeeded.

| 17    | Spell fails entirely. If the caster attempts to cast it again during the next 1d weeks, he must roll vs. HT. Failure means the spell fails and he’s struck mute for 1d minutes.

| 18    | Spell fails entirely. An extremely powerful spirit manifests, with a dangerous attitude toward the caster (perhaps the caster exploited its friends or subjects, or made annoying waves on the spirit plane). It may simply attack, but it’s more likely to set out to dissuade the caster and everyone else from such behavior. It might deliver educational and very public harm to the caster, take him as a slave or a pet, “invite” him to a dinner party that lasts several years, or engage him in a deadly game with his friends and enemies as playing pieces |

If he already has that – or if he lacks Magery – then any attempt to cast a spell results in an automatic critical failure.

If he lacks the points, or doesn’t want to spend them, then the disadvantage becomes permanent. Any disadvantage is possible – the wizard can become ugly, marginally insane, etc., at the GM’s whim                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 18     | As 16, but the disadvantage is worth -15 points, and costs 7 points to buy off                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19     | Wizard loses the ability to cast a single spell, chosen at random from his spell list, permanently. He still knows the spell, and it can still count as a prerequisite, but he can never cast it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 20     | As 16, but there are multiple disadvantages worth -30 points in total, and costing 15 points to buy off                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21     | As 15, but the problem lasts for 1d+1 months. At the end of that period, the wizard must roll against Will + Threshold Magery. Failure means that the condition becomes permanent. In extreme cases, this can cause the permanent loss of useful spellcasting ability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22     | Roll again with the same modifier. The result affects a randomly chosen companion of the wizard! If it’s one that affects spellcasting and the wizard has no casters among his companions, or if the wizard is operating completely alone, then roll twice (with the same modifier) and apply both results to the wizard himself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 23     | Wizard permanently loses 1dx5 points of advantages, attributes, and/or secondary characteristics.

| 24     | Caster becomes a living “mana-scar”! Within a 3d-mile radius of the wizard, casting and maintenance costs double (in terms of tally additions and, if regular spellcasting is possible in the setting, energy cost), and tally recovery halts. This effect lasts for 3d weeks. It also ends in the event of the wizard’s death. Enemies or impatient allies may decide on a quick solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 25     | Wizard’s skill with all spells is reduced by 3d+5.

| 27     | Wizard ages 2d+13 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 28     | A plague or a curse (locusts, storms, etc.) descends on the region, lasting for 3d weeks. No one will be able to trace this to the wizard, but he’ll be aware that it’s his fault. This can drive a benevolent wizard mad as he witnesses the suffering and destruction. Even vicious wizards may be inconvenienced – and worry that they’ll somehow be blamed. The GM should be grotesque and cruel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 29     | Wizard permanently loses the ability to cast spells (but not the knowledge – small comfort). The generous GM can treat this as a Divine Curse disadvantage (p. B132); the wizard might have a chance of eliminating the problem, given heroic effort or perhaps impressive and profound thaumatological research. Remember: at this level or higher, the spell may fail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30-39  | As 29, plus something permanent happens to the state of magic in a large region around the place where the casting went wrong. Perhaps all spells are cast at -2 in that kingdom from then on, or a certain class of spells functions erratically. The GM should be creative! If the wizard is found to be the culprit (and every concerned and able group will have a diviner on the job), then he could be a hunted man. Others may assume that killing him will remove the curse; they might be right. The wizard cannot get rid of the personal effect (if at all) without removing the problem from the region, and vice-versa |
| 40+    | As 30-39, but the change is global. In addition, the wizard must make a HT-6 roll. Failure means he’s consumed in a backlash of magical energy and explodes: he dies automatically (reduced to -10¥HP) and the explosion does (Will + Threshold Magery) dice of crushing explosive damage! Success on the HT-6 roll means a lessdramatic backlash: the wizard takes 2d dice of damage and doesn’t explode. If this kills him, then the global change may fade over a period of weeks or years – or it may stand as a memorial to his folly                                                                                          |

## Additional (minor) Ideas:

- The nearest tree(s) or Plant(s) burst into flower
- The nearest tree(s) or Plant(s) wither and die
- Caster takes 1 point of injury
- Minor additional residue buildup
- Spell produces a weak and useless shadow of a secondary spell as a side effect
- Spell causes a minor, temporary cosmetic mutation
- Spell causes a brief change in local lighting levels, startling (but not harmful) temperature variations for a few seconds, peculiar sound effects, etc.
- Spell fails entirely. Caster is surrounded by a flurry of dramatic and inconvenient sparks, illusions, etc, which do him 1 point of injury and singe his clothing or equipment, etc
