# Long-Term Fatigue:

## FP and LTFP:
- Regular FP-loss and regeneration are unaffected by the new system
- Max available FP-Pool is reduced by accumulated **Long-Term FP**
- Long-Term FP are accumulated by:
  - Missed Food/Drink
  - Missed Sleep (1 for up to 4 hours, 2 for up to 8)
  - Extreme environments (High altitude, High pressure, etc): 1 LTFP per hour
  - Extreme Cold (B430): 1 LTFP per hour without adequate shelter
  - Extreme Heat (B434): 1 LTFP per hour without shade/water
<br>

## Recovering LTP:
- At the end of each day that you eat enough, sleep enough and have adequate shelter, recover 4 LTFP
- 8 if doing nothing for an entire day
<br>

## Battle Fatigue:
- Halve the FP lost after each Battle
- Halve the FP spend on **Extra Effort**
- The result is your loss in LTFP
<br>
- Recovery: 1 LTFP (Battle) per hour without a Battle
<br>
