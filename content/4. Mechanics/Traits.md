# Quirks and Perks:

## Dialect (Language) 
- [1 pt]
- Prerequisite: Language spoken natively

---
## Dabbler
- [1]
- This perk allows one to buy up the relative penalties of *several related skills* they do **not** have for using them at default, so long as they do not surpass the penalty for using them at a single point.
- eight skills at default+1; trade two choices for **one** at default+2; four choices for **one** at default+3.
- Other skills can not default to the improved default

---
## Call of the Wild
-[1]
Prerequisite: Animal Empathy
- Your attunement with beasts lets you ignore up to -5 in penalties when you use skills such as Animal Handling on frightened, man-eating, mutant, or wild animals. If there’s a real animal in there, you can treat it more-or-less like a tame one, provided that you have appropriate skills.

---
## Striking Surface
- [1]
- Prerequisite: Damage Resistance 3+ 
- You have a hard body surface that increases barehanded damage. Your punch counts as having brass knuckles and your kick works as if wearing heavy boots. This gives +1 to damage

---
## Brotherhood†
- [1]
- One narrow group of potential foes – military unit, monster species, street gang, etc. – doesn’t like you but remains neutral toward you if you stay out of their way.
- They must know you’re there. Thus, this perk only works if you’re visible and identifiable
- Members of this group will shove you aside if you get between them and anything or anyone they’re out to attack, break, eat, rob, etc. If you do anything more hostile than get in the way, or refuse to step aside, you become a valid target.
- Brotherhood guarantees an automatic good reaction in return for your respect. As with all NPCs, some encounters with the affected group may involve predetermined reactions; these override your perk.
- Supernaturally controlled NPCs may likewise ignore it.

---
## Citizenship†
- [1]
- In settings where nations defend borders and restrict such things as voting rights and property ownership to citizens, each PC is assumed to be a citizen of one particular state, complete with passport, Social Security Number, etc.
- Each citizenship beyond the first is a perk. This isn’t Cultural Familiarity (p. B23) – you might “inherit” citizenship through a parent without ever encountering the associated culture!

---
## Friend†
- [1]
- You have a 1-point Claim to Hospitality (p. B41) with someone.
- Name the friend and his place of residence.
- When you visit him, you’ll have somewhere to stay.
- He’ll react to requests for aid like any NPC, but at +3. He isn’t a Contact, much less an Ally, and won’t get involved in adventures.

---
## Pet†
- [1]
- You have a small, ordinary pet – cat, ferret, hamster, parrot, etc.
- This is equivalent to a modest Ally balanced by being a modest Dependent, but don’t bother doing the math.
- Aside from companionship, a pet grants occasional, minor benefits; e.g., a kitten might hiss at ghosts and give you +1 to reactions from cat fanciers.
- Buying an animal as a Pet rather than with cash secures the GM’s promise to do what he can to avoid terrible fates for it provided that you do your best to keep it out of harm’s way. It’s effectively Signature Gear.
- **If you want an attack dog or a shoulder dragon, buy an Ally!**

---
## Sanitized Metabolism
- [1]
- You’re totally clean. Your body produces minimal, sanitized waste products, and you never suffer from bad breath, excessive perspiration, or unsightly skin problems. This gives -1 to attempts to track you by scent and +1 to reaction rolls in close confines (cramped spaceships, submarines, elevators, etc.).
