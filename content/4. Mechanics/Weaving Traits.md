# Weaving related Traits:

## Weak Latency†
- [1]
- Your weaving capabilities are too weak to do anything useful by yourself . . . but they are there, nonetheless. You can join a ritual and contribute FP to any cost incurred. There is no other effect; you do not add a skill or power bonus. You must roll against the better of EA or Expert Skill (Weaving Ritual†) to join the ritual. If you later buy Weaving Empowerment, the GM may let you “spend” the point from this perk on it. In settings where everyone is a little bit gifted, this may be a ubiquitous 0-point feature instead of a perk.
