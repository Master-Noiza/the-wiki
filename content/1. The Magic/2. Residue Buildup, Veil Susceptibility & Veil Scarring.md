## Residue Buildup, Veil Susceptibility & Veil Scarring

---

**Veil Susceptibility:**
- Governs overall risk of Veil related incidents
- Penalty on calamity checks
- Decides on which Critical Fail Table a Weaver must roll
- Comes in Levels:
  - 0: +1 per 5 points over ER when rolling for calamities, Base Crit Fail Table (Can not be removed)
  - 1: +1 per 4 points over ER when rolling for calamities, 2nd Crit Fail Table
  - 2: +1 per 3 points over ER when rolling for calamities, 3rd Crit Fail Table
  - 3: +1 per 2 points over ER when rolling for calamities, 4th Crit Fail Table
  - 4: +1 per 1 point over ER when rolling for calamities, 5th Crit Fail Table
  - 5: +2 per 1 point over ER when rolling for calamities, 5th Crit Fail Table
- New Traits: [[4. Mechanics/Traits#Reduced Veil Susceptibility\|Reduced Veil Susceptibility]] & [[4. Mechanics/Traits#Increased Veil Susceptibility\|Increased Veil Susceptibility]]
<br>

**Residue Buildup:**
- Weaving spells, carving runes & interacting with Essence in any way leaves *Essence Residue* in the weaver's body & Soul
- High Residue (< 1x ER, > 2x ER, > 3x ER) leads to:
  - Increasingly harsh, **stacking** side-effects from *Backlash*,
  - Additional Levels and at > 3x ER an additional roll in *Attracts Threats*,
  - Additional Levels in "Radically unstable Magery", after level 3: 16 is a crit fail, after level 4: 15 is a crit fail
- Residue buildup has levels: 1 Res/8 Energy spend, 1 Res/4 Energy, 1 Res/2 Energy, 1 Res/1 Energy, 2 Res/1 Energy, 4 Res/1 Energy, 8 Res/1 Energy (**1 to 1 is default**)
- Every Species has a innate level of residue-buildup
- New Traits: [Reduced Residue Buildup](../4.%20Mechanics/Weaving%20Traits.md#Reduced%20Residue%20Buildup) & [Increased Residue Buildup](../4.%20Mechanics/Weaving%20Traits.md#Increased%20Residue%20Buildup)
- Weaver's innate Residue-Buildup rate always **overrules** the Spell's rate
- Residue can be reduced via Spells from the [Essence Discipline](3.%20The%20Disciplines%20&%20Aspects.md#Essence) of magic
- Natural recovery: 8 res after a **restful** night
- Increase by Meditation-Level/10, **if meditating before sleep**
    - 8 x (Meditation-lvl/10)
    - Round any decimals
<br>

**Veil Scarring:**
- Option to **overspend** ER via "Veil Scarring" (Essentially Threshold-Magic)
- Maximum Energy from "Veil Scarring" = ER x (3 + lvl in reduced/increased Veil-Scarring)
- Thresholds: >1 x ER, >2 x ER, >3 x ER, etc
- Higher Thresholds increase **Residue buildup** (One Level of res-buildup/Threshold-level)
- Breaching a Threshold calls for a roll on the appropriate [[4. Mechanics/Tables#Calamity Tables\|Calamity Tables]]
<br>

**Calamity Checks:**
- A roll on the [[4. Mechanics/Tables#Calamity Tables\|Calamity Tables]] – on any turn that the weaver scars the Veil for any reason.
- While over ER, a Calamity Check is required on any turn that a spell is cast (even one with zero cost) or maintained.
- Roll 3d and add 1 for every full 5 points over ER after this casting (Modified by "Veil Susceptibility")
- Calamities take effect immediately, but their nature may not always be apparent to the weaver (see the table for details).
- Calamities don’t normally cause the spell to fail. However, if the Calamity Check total is 29+, then the spell does fail unless the caster can make a Will roll at a penalty equal to the bonus to the Calamity Check
