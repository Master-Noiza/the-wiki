# The Spells
---

## Learning, constructing and developing new spells:

- Each Weaving Talent unlocks a defined set of basic spells
- These are **very** basic and represent a bare minimum of arcane/spiritual understanding of the underlying concept
<br>
- In order to get access to more powerful spells, a caster can take a few different approaches and must possess the required prerequisites:
<br>
- Knowledge of all the involved aspects to "construct" the new spell if developing it themselves
- Knowledge of spells that logically can be seen as stepping stones to the new spell
- Most of the time there can be multiple approaches to the same goal
- e.g. To learn **Gust** one might need knowledge in "Matter (Gas) - "Shape/Create Air" and "Forces (Pressure)", To learn **Ice Dagger** one might need knowledge in "Energy (Heat)" - "Freeze", either "Matter (Liquid)" - "Create Water" or access to a source of freezable liquid (possibly via "Seek Water") and "Forces (Pressure)"
- This is most relevant for **Elementalism**, **Essence Carving** and **Aethermancy**
- **Shamanism**,  and **Mindshaping** tend to be more self-contained
- See [Creating new Spells](5.%20Creating%20new%20Spells.md) for details

- Access to a willing teacher or a detailed written account to learn spells without knowing logical stepping stone spells
- All spells can be *transcribed* into usable scrolls/books, either for one-time casting or for teaching purposes
