## Spell Modification on the fly:

**Note:** Effect & Parameter Modification *can* be combined, but any spell can be weaved with modified parameters.

- In contrast to [Spell modification - Stable](7.%20Spell%20modification%20-%20Stable.md), this is a more risky, less stable option.
- In a pinch, without preperation time or when a situation calls for extreme actions, it can be a viable, yet potentially dangerous solution.

**The Process**:
- Choose the temporary enhancements for the spell, this can include further levels in the base advantage
- Add a -1 penalty to the roll for every 10% added this way
- Add 1 Energy to the base cost of the spell for every 10% added this way
- In essence the result is a technique, but it can never be learned above default
- **The viability of such modifications is up to GM-approveal**
