# Essence Weaving:
---

## Basic Concepts:

- New attribute: **Essence Attunement** (EA)
  - (IQ + HT)/2
  - 10 CP/lvl
  - Governs "Essence Reserve" (ER can be bought for 3 CP, up to 30% over EA)
  - Governs available "Weaving-Talent"-lvls
  - EA 10-11: "Weaving-Talent" 1, EA 12-13: "Weaving-Talent" 2, EA 14-15: "Weaving-Talent" 3 and so on

<br>

- **Essence Reserve**:
  - Spells costing ER can *not* be paid for with regular FP!
  - Does not recharge automatically
  - Can be recharged via spells from the [Essence Discipline](3.%20The%20Disciplines%20&%20Aspects.md#Essence)
  - Can be recharged by Meditation: 2/h
  - Increase by: Meditation-Level/10
    - 2 x (Meditation-lvl/10)
    - Round any decimals

<br>

- **Spells are Powers and Skills**:
  - Each spell requires a casting roll against an **Aspect Skill** and, if relevant, a second roll **to attack** (Essentially replacing **innate attack**).
  - Each Aspect Skill is a (VH) EA skill that defaults to EA-based Thaumatology-5
  - A defaulted Aspect Skill cannot be higher than 15
  - If a spell belongs to multiple aspects, then the caster rolls against the **lower** of those Aspect Skills.
  - Aspect Skill Rolls are modified by the Weaving-Talent level

<br>

- **Weaving Talents**:
  - Each Discipline is represented by a *Talent* (Essentially replacing Magery)
  - e.g. Weaving Talent (Shamanism)
  - Each Talent costs **5 CP/Level**
  - Talent lvl gives a bonus on associated **Aspect-skill Rolls**
  - Talent lvl gives a bonus on learning/creating associated Spells
  - Some Spells may require a certain level in the Talent to be learnable
<br>
---
## Weaving Empowerment:
- Cost: 4/2
- Each discipline of magic has its own Weaving Empowerment (e.g. Weaving Empowerment (Shamanism))
- All spells are **Alternative Abilities**, based on their governing Weaving Empowerment
- Cost of spells, excluding "Alternative Ability" can not exceed cost of Weaving Empowerment
- Learning an "Empowerment" unlocks **very** basic spells on lvl 1 **for free**
<br>

- **Temporary Preperation:**
  - Uses weaving empowerment **level** to determine which spells can be prepared.
  - Requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a spell
  - Requires 1 hour of preperation/memorization
  - Requires an EA-based Thaumatology Roll + Talent-Bonus
  - Once prepared, the weaving is treated as "known" and can be cast normally
<br>

- **Desperate Preperation:**
  - Uses **total** CP spend on "Weaving Empowerment" to determine which spells can be prepared
  - Requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a spell
  - Requires 1 hour of preperation/memorization
  - Requires an EA-based Thaumatology Roll + Talent-Bonus
  - Once prepared, the weaver has a **single** spell ready
  - *Desperately* prepared spells lead to increased "Essence Residue"-buildup in the weaver (raised by two (2) levels)
<br>

- **Preperation-Slots:**
  - Additional instances of Weaving Empowerment may be bought
  - Each prep-slot **only** allows preperation of spells from its type of magic
  - Additional instances are **Alternative Abilities** to the most expensive Instance (1/5th cost)
  - Additional instances can not be worth more CP than the main instance
  - Each instance grants **one** preperation-slot
  - Prepared spells can't exceed their governing Weaving Empowerment in CP-worth
<br>

### Weaving Empowerment (Essence-Carving):
  - Cost: 4/2
  - **Temporary Preperation:** is the same as for the other Magical Styles
    - Uses Weaving Empowerment **level** to determine which spells can be prepared.
    - Requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a carving
    - Requires 1 hour of preperation/memorization
    - Requires a EA-based Symbol-Drawing Roll + Talent-Bonus
    - Once prepared, the carving is treated as "known" and can be used normally
  - **Desperate Preperation:**
    - Change to the other Styles: Takes 24 hrs instead of 1 hr
    - No increase in **Residue buildup**
<br>

## Aspect-Skill-roll to cast:
  - Roll modified by **lowest** corresponding Weaving Talent-lvl
  - Spontaneous enhancements of known spells (Damage, Range, Duration, etc)
  - Spontaneous modification of casting parameters (Time spend, Energy spend, Rituals used, etc)
  - Casting parameters reduce/increase the penalties on the casting-roll
  - Spontaneous enhancements increase the penalties on the casting roll
  - Penalties can be balanced out by spending more FP/HP and/or adjusting the casting parameters
  - See [Spell modification - On the Fly](6.%20Spell%20modification%20-%20On%20the%20Fly.md) for details
  - Spontaneously modified spells can **not** be cast above default
  - Spells can be modified in a more stable, prepared manner too
  - See [Spell modification - Stable](7.%20Spell%20modification%20-%20Stable.md) for details
<br>

**The skills are equivalent to the Aspects (The subcategories of the Magical Types):**
- Elementalism:
    - Energy
    - Matter
    - Forces
-  Aethermancy:
    -  Essence
    - Time
    - Space
- Mindshaping:
  - Empathy
  - Manipulation
- Shamanism:
  - The Cycle
  - Breaking the Cycle
  - Piercing the Veil
- Essence Carving:
  - Protection
  - Aggression
  - Utility

<br>

- **Sub-Aspects** (e.g. Heat, Life, Matter, etc) can be bought as optional (EA/Hard) specialities
<br>

### Supporting Skills:
  - **Symbol Drawing** (Integral for Shamanistic Magic, Essence Carving and Circle Drawing)
  - **Thaumatology** (For understanding, learning and constructing new spells, also as a default for the Aspect-Skills)
  - **Mundane knowledge & crafting skills** as support for Aspect-Skills (e.g. Leatherworking for Essence-Carving (Leather), Most Natural Science Skills for Elementalism, Outdoor & Medical Skills for Shamanism, etc)
<br>

## Acquiring new Spells:
  - Only known styles/aspects can be used for spell construction
  - Only when logically sound, can a new spell be constructed without outside help
  - E.g. Fireball might need Matter, Heat and Pressure & Knowledge of "Create Fire" and "Gust" (Many routes might be feasible)
  - Process: [Creating new Spells](5.%20Creating%20new%20Spells.md)
  - New Trait: [Spell/Rune Crafter](../4.%20Mechanics/Traits.md#Spell/Rune%20Crafter)
  - Only exception: Learning from detailed written accounts or teachers
  - Spell (Power) cost (after "Alternative Ability-Limitation") can not exceed points in "Weaving Empowerment"
