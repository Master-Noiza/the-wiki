# Essence Weaving:
---

## Basic Concepts:

- New attribute: **Essence Attunement** (EA)
  - (IQ + HT)/2
  - 10 CP/lvl
  - Governs "Essence Reserve" (ER can be bought for 3 CP, up to 30% over EA)
  - Governs available "Weaving-Talent"-lvls
  - EA 10-11: "Weaving-Talent" 1, EA 12-13: "Weaving-Talent" 2, EA 14-15: "Weaving-Talent" 3 and so on
<br>

- **Essence Reserve**:
  - Spells costing ER can *not* be paid for with regular FP!
  - Does not recharge automatically
  - Can be recharged via spells from the [[1. The Magic/2. The Disciplines & Aspects#Essence\|Essence Dicipline]]
  - Can be recharged by Meditation: 2/h
  - Increase by: Meditation-Level/10
    - 2 x (Meditation-lvl/10)
    - Round any decimals
<br>

- **Spells are Powers and Skills**:
  - Each spell requires a casting roll against an **Aspect Skill** and, if relevant, a second roll **to attack** (Essentially replacing **innate attack**).
  - Each Aspect Skill is a (VH) EA skill that defaults to EA-based Thaumatology-5
  - A defaulted Aspect Skill cannot be higher than 15
  - If a spell belongs to multiple aspects, then the caster rolls against the **lower** of those Aspect Skills.
  - Aspect Skill Rolls are modified by the Weaving-Talent level
<br>

- **Weaving Talents**:
  - Each Discipline is represented by a *Talent* (Essentially replacing Magery)
  - e.g. Weaving Talent (Shamanism)
  - Each Talent costs **5 CP/Level**
  - Talent lvl gives a bonus on associated **Aspect-skill Rolls**
  - Talent lvl gives a bonus on learning/creating associated Spells
  - Some Spells may require a certain level in the Talent to be learnable
<br>

### Weaving Empowerment:
- Cost: 4/2
- Each discipline of magic has its own Weaving Empowerment (e.g. Weaving Empowerment (Shamanism))
- All spells are **Alternative Abilities**, based on their governing Weaving Empowerment
- Cost of spells, excluding "Alternative Ability" can not exceed cost of Weaving Empowerment
- Learning an "Empowerment" unlocks **very** basic spells on lvl 1 **for free**
<br>

- **Temporary Preperation:**
  - Uses weaving empowerment **level** to determine which spells can be prepared.
  - Requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a spell
  - Requires 1 hour of preperation/memorization
  - Requires an EA-based Thaumatology Roll + Talent-Bonus
  - Once prepared, the weaving is treated as "known" and can be cast normally
<br>

- **Desperate Preperation:**
  - Uses **total** CP spend on "Weaving Empowerment" to determine which spells can be prepared
  - Requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a spell
  - Requires 1 hour of preperation/memorization
  - Requires an EA-based Thaumatology Roll + Talent-Bonus
  - Once prepared, the weaver has a **single** spell ready
  - *Desperately* prepared spells lead to increased "Essence Residue"-buildup in the weaver (raised by two (2) levels)
<br>

- **Preperation-Slots:**
  - Additional instances of Weaving Empowerment may be bought
  - Each prep-slot **only** allows preperation of spells from its type of magic
  - Additional instances are **Alternative Abilities** to the most expensive Instance (1/5th cost)
  - Additional instances can not be worth more CP than the main instance
  - Each instance grants **one** preperation-slot
  - Prepared spells can't exceed their governing Weaving Empowerment in CP-worth
<br>

- ##### Weaving Empowerment (Essence-Carving):
  - Cost: 4/2
  - **Temporary Preperation:** is the same as for the other Magical Styles
    - Uses Weaving Empowerment **level** to determine which spells can be prepared.
    - Requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a carving
    - Requires 1 hour of preperation/memorization
    - Requires a EA-based Symbol-Drawing Roll + Talent-Bonus
    - Once prepared, the carving is treated as "known" and can be used normally
  - **Desperate Preperation:**
    - Change to the other Styles: Takes 24 hrs instead of 1 hr
    - No increase in **Residue buildup**

<br>
---

#### Aspect-Skill-roll to cast:
  - Roll modified by **lowest** corresponding Weaving Talent-lvl
  - Spontaneous enhancements of known spells (Damage, Range, Duration, etc)
  - Spontaneous modification of casting parameters (Time spend, Energy spend, Rituals used, etc)
  - Casting parameters reduce/increase the penalties on the casting-roll
  - Spontaneous enhancements increase the penalties on the casting roll
  - Penalties can be balanced out by spending more FP/HP and/or adjusting the casting parameters
  - See [[1. The Magic/5. Spell modification - On the Fly\|Spell modification - On the Fly]] for details
  - Spontaneously modified spells can **not** be cast above default
  - Spells can be modified in a more stable, prepared manner too
  - See [[1. The Magic/6. Spell modification - Stable\|Spell modification - Stable]] for details
<br>

**The skills are equivalent to the Aspects (The subcategories of the Magical Types):**
  - Energy
  - Matter
  - Forces
  - Essence
  - Time
  - Space
  - Empathy
  - Manipulation
  - The Cycle
  - Breaking the Cycle
  - Piercing the Veil
  - TBD: Runic Magic/Essence Carving
<br>
- **Sub-Aspects** (e.g. Heat, Life, Matter, etc) can be bought as optional (EA/Hard) specialities
<br>

#### Supporting Skills:
  - **Symbol Drawing** (Integral for Shamanistic Magic, Essence Carving and Circle Drawing)
  - **Thaumatology** (For understanding, learning and constructing new spells, also as a default for the Aspect-Skills)
  - **Mundane knowledge & crafting skills** as support for Aspect-Skills (e.g. Leatherworking for Essence-Carving (Leather), Most Natural Science Skills for Elementalism, Outdoor & Medical Skills for Shamanism, etc)
<br>
---
#### Acquiring new Spells:
  - Only known styles/aspects can be used for spell construction
  - Only when logically sound, can a new spell be constructed without outside help
  - E.g. Fireball might need Matter, Heat and Pressure & Knowledge of "Create Fire" and "Gust" (Many routes might be feasible)
  - Process: [[1. The Magic/4. Creating new Spells\|Creating new Spells]]
  - New Trait: [[4. Mechanics/Traits#Spell/Rune Crafter\|Spell/Rune Crafter]]
  - Only exception: Learning from detailed written accounts or teachers
  - Spell (Power) cost (after "Alternative Ability-Limitation") can not exceed points in "Weaving Empowerment"

#### [[1. The Magic/7. Residue Buildup, Veil Susceptibility & Veil Scarring\|Residue Buildup, Veil Susceptibility & Veil Scarring]]:

**Veil Susceptibility:**
- Governs overall risk of Veil related incidents
- Penalty on calamity checks
- Decides on which Critical Fail Table a Weaver must roll
- Comes in Levels:
  - 0: +1 per 5 points over ER when rolling for calamities, Base Crit Fail Table (Can not be removed)
  - 1: +1 per 4 points over ER when rolling for calamities, 2nd Crit Fail Table
  - 2: +1 per 3 points over ER when rolling for calamities, 3rd Crit Fail Table
  - 3: +1 per 2 points over ER when rolling for calamities, 4th Crit Fail Table
  - 4: +1 per 1 point over ER when rolling for calamities, 5th Crit Fail Table
  - 5: +2 per 1 point over ER when rolling for calamities, 5th Crit Fail Table
- New Traits: [[4. Mechanics/Traits#Reduced Veil Susceptibility\|Reduced Veil Susceptibility]] & [[4. Mechanics/Traits#Increased Veil Susceptibility\|Increased Veil Susceptibility]]
<br>

**Residue Buildup:**
- Weaving spells, carving runes & interacting with Essence in any way leaves *Essence Residue* in the weaver's body & Soul
- High Residue (< 1x ER, > 2x ER, > 3x ER) leads to:
  - Increasingly harsh, **stacking** side-effects from *Backlash*,
  - Additional Levels and at > 3x ER an additional roll in *Attracts Threats*,
  - Additional Levels in "Radically unstable Magery", after level 3: 16 is a crit fail, after level 4: 15 is a crit fail
- Residue buildup has levels: 1 Res/8 Energy spend, 1 Res/4 Energy, 1 Res/2 Energy, 1 Res/1 Energy, 2 Res/1 Energy, 4 Res/1 Energy, 8 Res/1 Energy (**1 to 1 is default**)
- Every Species has a innate level of residue-buildup
- New Traits: [[4. Mechanics/Traits#Reduced Residue Buildup\|Reduced Residue Buildup]] & [[4. Mechanics/Traits#Increased Residue Buildup\|Increased Residue Buildup]]
- Weaver's innate Residue-Buildup rate always **overrules** the Spell's rate
- Residue can be reduced via Spells from the [[1. The Magic/2. The Disciplines & Aspects#Essence\|Essence discipline]] of magic
- Natural recovery: 8 res after a **restful** night
- Increase by Meditation-Level/10, **if meditating before sleep**
    - 8 x (Meditation-lvl/10)
    - Round any decimals
<br>

**Veil Scarring:**
- Option to **overspend** ER via "Veil Scarring" (Essentially Threshold-Magic)
- Maximum Energy from "Veil Scarring" = ER x (3 + lvl in reduced/increased Veil-Scarring)
- Thresholds: >1 x ER, >2 x ER, >3 x ER, etc
- Higher Thresholds increase **Residue buildup** (One Level of res-buildup/Threshold-level)
- Breaching a Threshold calls for a roll on the appropriate [[4. Mechanics/Tables#Calamity Tables\|Calamity Tables]]
<br>

**Calamity Checks:**
- A roll on the [[4. Mechanics/Tables#Calamity Tables\|Calamity Tables]] – on any turn that the weaver scars the Veil for any reason.
- While over ER, a Calamity Check is required on any turn that a spell is cast (even one with zero cost) or maintained.
- Roll 3d and add 1 for every full 5 points over ER after this casting (Modified by "Veil Susceptibility")
- Calamities take effect immediately, but their nature may not always be apparent to the weaver (see the table for details).
- Calamities don’t normally cause the spell to fail. However, if the Calamity Check total is 29+, then the spell does fail unless the caster can make a Will roll at a penalty equal to the bonus to the Calamity Check

### Potential Additions and To-Dos:

- Build custom Critical Failure tables
- Build Tables for spontaneous spell enhancement
- Build all kinds of tables
