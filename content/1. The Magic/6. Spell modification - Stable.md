## Stable modification of known Spells:

Instead of creating a new spell for every use case, or searching for a scroll/teacher, a Weaver may choose to modify a known spell instead.

In contrast to [[1. The Magic/5. Spell modification - On the Fly\|Spell modification on the fly]], this is a more permanent and stable approach.

This can **not** alter the underlying spell fundamentally. For that use [[1. The Magic/4. Creating new Spells\|Creating new Spells]] instead.

Examples:
- Adding an explosion and and "homing" to a fireball is a modification.
- Transforming a fireball into a rain of fire or firestorm is a invention.

Modifications use the same rules as Spell Creations except for the following:
- The effective CP-value is based on the **modification**, not the entire spell
- The difficulty modifier is far more forgiving (See below)
- When determining side-effects, **halve** the GM-Roll is halved (round up)
