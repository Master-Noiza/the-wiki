## **[[2. The Races/The Monkhalyr/The Monkhalyr - Mechanics\|The Monkhalyr]]**

### **Origin and Background:**

The Monkhalyr were the first and most dominant species, responsible for building vast empires and mastering both the mundane and the arcane. Their ambition and overreach, however, led to the collapse of their once-great civilizations. In their relentless pursuit of arcane power and innovation, they pushed the boundaries of reality, stretching, piercing and rupturing the *Veil* that separates the material world from the Mirror. This culminated in a catastrophic event, known as the Convergence. It tore open the barrier between reality and the chaotic Mirror, unleashing devastation across the world. This tragedy occurred aeons ago, but its effects still linger.

### **Current State:**

Today, human civilization is a fractured shadow of its former glory. Small, war-torn kingdoms, tribes and city-states are all that remain of the once-mighty human empires. These remnants are constantly embroiled in conflicts, both among themselves and against other races. The Monkhalyr are a dying race, clinging to the remnants of their past while facing an uncertain future. The ruins of their ancient civilizations are haunted by the aftermath of the Convergence, where the Veil remains unstable, thin, and brittle. These places are rich in arcane potential and powerful ancient artifacts, but bear the risk of repeating past mistakes.

### **Magic and Society:**

The Monkhalyr’s primary magic is Elementalism. This powerful, versatile form of magic, while potent, draws directly from the Mirror, making it highly unstable and dangerous. Despite the risks, some humans still seek to harness its power, driven by the desperate hope of restoring their former glory or protecting what little remains of their world.

## **[[2. The Races/3. The Markhalyr\|The Markhalyr]]**
    
### **Origin and Background:**
    
The Markhalyr are an ancient race, born from the heart of the mountains. Their existence is not a result of natural evolution. Like many, it is the direct result of the convergence, the ancient cataclysm when the Veil was ripped apart and reality and the Mirror merged. During those times, a group of humans, seeking refuge from collapsing empires, delved too deep into the earth. There, they discovered raw, primordial magic that would forever change their fate. Exposure to this unstable magic transformed them, merging their flesh with stone and metal, and thus, the Markhalyr were born.
    
### **Physical Characteristics:**
    
The Markhalyr are humanoid but distinctly inhuman. Their skin is rough and stone-like, with veins of metal and crystal running through their bodies. Patches of basalt, ore, and metal form natural armor on their bodies, making them incredibly resilient. Their eyes glow faintly with an inner fire, a remnant of the magical energies that transformed them. The Markhalyr possess immense strength and durability, with lifespans that can stretch for centuries. However, these gifts come at the cost of their humanity—both physically and mentally, they are becoming more like the stone from which they were born.

    
 ### **Sustenance and the Veil:**
    
Unlike most living beings, the Markhalyr do not consume food or drink. Instead, they draw their sustenance directly from the Mirror. This unique form of nourishment allows them to live without the need for traditional resources, but it comes with a dire consequence. By feeding off the Mirror, the Markhalyr constantly stretch the Veil—the barrier between the physical world and the arcane realms. Over the centuries, in areas with a significant Markhalyr presence, the Veil becomes thin and brittle, leading to an increased risk of arcane disturbances and otherworldly incursions. This gradual weakening of the Veil is a source of great concern for the Markhalyr.
    
### **Society and Culture:**
    
The Markhalyr live in vast underground cities carved and molded into the roots of mountains. Their society is rigid and hierarchical, placing great value on craftsmanship, duty, and stoicism. The Markhalyr are a people haunted by the knowledge that their race is slowly dying. Each generation is born with more stone and less flesh, and living newborns are becoming increasingly rare. This has led to a deep fatalism within their culture, with many believing that they are a doomed people.
    
### **Magic and Abilities:**
    
Due to their constant exposure to the Mirror due to their source of sustenance, the Markhalyr are naturally resistant to magical attacks. However, this resistance comes with a drawback—they are almost completely unable to use magic themselves. To overcome this limitation, they have developed their own form of magic known as "Essence Carving." This practice involves the meticulous engraving of runes and symbols into their stone bodies or crafted objects, imbuing them with specific magical properties.

## **[[2. The Races/4. The Venthalyr\|The Venthalyr]]**
    
### **Origin and Background:**
    
The Vethalyr were once humans who, over millennia, became deeply intertwined with the wild and chaotic magic of their ancient forest homes. These forests, aeons ago permanently altered by the cataclysmic event known as the Convergence, exist as a mixture of reality and the Mirror—a twisted, arcane reflection of the world. The magical energy that flows freely through these woods has spurred an unnatural evolution in the Venthalyr, transforming them into beings that are far more... And less than they where before. Physically, the Venthalyr are perfectly adapted to life in these enchanted forests. They possess elongated limbs and digits, with hard, claw-like nails ideal for climbing. Their large, light-sensitive eyes faintly glow in the dark, and their keen sense of hearing is unparalleled. Their skin tones range from murky brown to mossy green, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings. Some have even more adaptations to their environment: Long, prehensile tails, the ability to swing proficiently from tree to tree and many more.
    
 ### **Connection to Their Forests:**
    
The Venthalyr draw their life force from the very essence of their twisted forests. Within these bounds, they are seemingly unaging—some say even immortal. However, this deep connection comes with a significant limitation: the Venthalyr are significantly weaker outside these woods. This dependency drives them to constantly expand their forests, assimilating new territory to ensure their continued existence and growing influence.
    
 ### **Reproduction and Population:**
    
Due to extreme mutations and the constant arcane radiation of their environment, the Venthalyr are practically sterile, making each individual life precious. To combat this decline, they heavily rely on humans, either captured through raids or sujugated and assimilated into their society. Whenever a human gives birth within the twisted bounds of the Venthalyr forests, the population of the Venthalyr grows by one.
    
### **Society and Expansionism:**
    
The Venthalyr see themselves as superior to all other beings, a belief that fuels their expansionist nature. They are fiercely protective of their territory and do not tolerate any incursions. Their society is constantly at war, sending out raiding parties and planting satellite forests to weaken nearby lands before assimilating them into their ever-growing forest domain. While outside their forests, the Venthalyr are noticeably weaker, they compensate with guerrilla tactics and the ability to summon deadly creatures native to their woods.
    
### **Primary Magic:**
    
The Venthalyr's primary arcane discipline is a twisted form of shamanic blood-magic known as **Breaking the Cycle**. This form of magic, fueled mostly by blood sacrifices, draws on the dark, twisted energies of their forests, focusing on unnatural transformation, mutation, and the manipulation of life and death. This magic is both a reflection of their environment and a means of exerting control over it, allowing them to survive and thrive in a world that has become as dangerous and unpredictable as they are.

## **[[2. The Races/5. The Anthalyr\|The Anthalyr]]**

### **Origin and Background:**

A splinter group of the Venthalyr who rejected their ancestors' brutal expansionism, the Anthalyr fled north ten-thousands of years ago, seeking a simpler, more honorable way of life. The Anthalyr have further evolved from their forest dwelling ancestors, perfectly adapting to the harsh, unforgiving climate of the tundra and northern steppes. They are of similar height, but way more muscular and bulky. Due to beeing cut off from the arcane forests for centuries or Aeons, they do not suffer physical weakening without them, but at the same time their lifespan is greatly reduced, almost never eclipsing that of a average Monkhalyr.

### **Society and Culture:**

The Anthalyr are a nomadic people, traveling the tundras and cold steppes, living in yurts and herding semi-domesticated woolly rhinos. They have a deep connection to nature, but unlike the Wood Elves, they do not corrupt it; instead, they strive to live in harmony with it. They are organized into clans, each led by a chieftain and a shaman. Their society values strength, loyalty, and respect for the natural world. They have developed their own form of magic, deeply rooted in spiritualism and shamanic rituals. Although it might seem more stable and less corruptive than that of the Venthalyr, it is also relying heavily on blood sacrifice, communion with the mirror and manipulation of the Veil.

## **[[2. The Races/6. The Urashalyr\|The Urashalyr]]**
    
### **Origin and Background**
    
The Urashalyr defy the brutish, bloodthirsty, and violent stereotypes often associated with their kind. Originating from humans during the Convergence, they evolved in the harshest environments—barren mountains, arid deserts, and volcanic plains—where survival required not just strength but intelligence, organization, and adaptability. Over centuries, these harsh conditions forged them into one of the most advanced and disciplined societies in the world.
    
### **Society and Structure**
    
The Urashalyr society is structured into a rigid caste system that includes workers, warriors, scholars, artisans, diplomats, rulers, and more. Each caste has its own hierarchy, with limited mobility between castes, which requires exceptional merit. This system is not seen as oppressive but rather as the natural order, with each caste being respected and valued for its role in society. While they are known and feared for their military prowess, the Urakhalyr are also philosophers, poets, and scientists. A general is as likely to quote ancient poetry as they are to command a battlefield. Despite their ferocious and uncompromising war tactics, they prefer diplomacy over outright conquest, though they are fully capable of the latter. Their complex system of alliances and vassal states often absorbs smaller cultures peacefully through negotiation and protection. However, when war is inevitable, the Urakhalyr use overwhelming force and any means necessary to achieve quick, decisive victories. Respected enemies are often offered a chance to surrender and are integrated into the realm after battle. However, no such mercy is shown to those deemed dishonorable, who face utter destruction and erasure from history.
    
### **Physical Appearance**
    
The Urakhalyr are tall, with builds ranging from lean to muscular, reflecting their warrior heritage. Their skin varies from dark green to almost black, adorned with intricate tattoos that signify rank, achievements, and clan allegiance. Their eyes are sharp and often brightly colored—yellow, red, or orange. As they age, Urakhalyr grow impressive tusks, which they carve and engrave with intricate designs.
    
### **Culture and Achievements**
    
Urakhalyr culture is rich and diverse, with a deep appreciation for the arts. They are renowned for their epic poetry, which chronicles their history and the deeds of their greatest heroes. Their architecture is monumental, with grand cities of stone and metal that reflect both their martial and cultural achievements. Music plays a significant role in their culture, often used to inspire troops or celebrate victories. Innovation is highly valued in Urakhalyr society, both in warfare and civil life. New ideas and approaches are encouraged, leading to a society that constantly evolves and adapts.
    
### **Magic**
    
The Urakhalyr's primary magic is called **Mindshaping**, reflecting their deep understanding of mental and emotional manipulation, strategy, and the subtle arts of control and influence.

## **[[2. The Races/7. The Varashalyr\|The Varashalyr]]**
    
### **Origin and Background**

The Varakhalyr, a rather primitive race, have started diverging from the Urakhalyr aeons ago, mere generations after those evolved from the Monkhalyr during the Convergence.
They share their chosen habitat, the subterranean caves and tunnels deep underneath the surface of the world with the Markhalyr and many other, way less civilized species.

## **[[2. The Races/9_The Weshkhalyr\|The Weakhalyr]]**

- they are remnants of the early, great human (Monkhalyr) civilizations
- those civilisations obviously must have been way ahead of today in magical prowess
- at the convergence, this "evolution" of Monkhalyr was intrinsically linked to elementalism
- they are born almost indistinguishable from regular Monkhalyr, if maybe a bit frail.
- they soon show signs of great potential, but also great weakness
- greed, obsession, Lust for power etc
- it usually is not long until they start to change, representing their aspect of elementalism more
- soon after that many shed their Monkhalyr shell and "ascend"
- and not too long after that they often fully loose themselves
