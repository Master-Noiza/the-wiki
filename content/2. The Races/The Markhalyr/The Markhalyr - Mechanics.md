> [!warning|no-i c-black]- Creeping Demise [min. 0 pts, varies]
> *The cursed Markhalyr all share a common fate, a cruel twist on their greatly prolonged biological lifespan. No amount of genetical luck or being born without large lumps of stone merged to their bodies, all individuals will start the process of petrification when they reach 400 years of age. This slow but inevitable demise ultimately leaves them unable to move, at the very latest when they reach 800 years of age.*
