# Dekh'Sazharneth - The Twelve
---

The gods in this world are rarely altruistic (except for the "Benevolent Stranger" and his motives might prove to be somewhat questionable aswell) and usually act far removed from the affairs of mortals. Temples and holidays may exist, but should someone have to choose between worship and fear, they would be wise to choose fear. Possibly the gods are even entirely removed, sleeping or dead. 
Whatever the case may be, these gods are the "young" ones, the ones which wrestled control over reality from the primordials in the beginning of time.

---
## "She Who Weeps":

- Goddess of sorrow, pain, despair, hopelessness, loss, compassion, love, agriculture, fertility.

- She was the mother of the one who became the "Bound God" and helped shape him into a weapon against the Primordials. Later, she also aided in his imprisonment amidst tears and screams of despair.
- Symbol: Folded hands and a teardrop-shaped amulet.

---
## "The Silent King":

- God of emptiness, order, silence, peace, final rest, infinity, the stillness of death, sleep, untouched nature, natural order.

- It is said that when everything returns to ash, dust, and silence, when the screams fade away, the Silent King will smile.
- Symbol: A moonlit, silent lake, covered in mist.

---
## "The Bound One":

- God of destruction, hatred, chaos, rage, violent ends, natural disasters, war, subjugation.

- Before the time of mortals, even before the gods, the Primordials created reality, the universe, and matter. The Primordials represent chaotic, incomprehensible, vague concepts and aspects of reality and the immaterium. When the still young gods finally grew strong and saw the endless possibilities of the universe, they became greedy, jealous, and filled with fear, sparking an unrelenting, endless, brutal war for supremacy. Eventually, the gods decided to pour all their negative emotions and destructive aspects into one being, a vessel. The son of "She Who Weeps" and the "Burning Judge," young, strong, full of potential, became the weapon that turned the tide of the war. The gods ultimately won, but they were too weak to kill their creation. Instead, they wounded and bound him. To this day, the Bound God sleeps in chains, in agony, full of hatred, eternally struggling, ever ready to break his bonds and annihilate the universe.
- Symbol: Broken chains.

---
## "The Shattered Queen":

- Goddess of storms, madness, fragmentation, nightmares, dreams, hidden knowledge, thunderstorms, mental health.

---
## "The Warden of Shadows":

- God of shadows, secrets, deceit, cunning, fear, the hunt, oceans.

- The Warden of Shadows is both protector and manipulator, preserving secrets and hiding those who wish to remain concealed. He uses fear for control and influence, his presence felt in the hidden corners of the world and the secrets of the ocean depths.
- Symbol: A shadowy figure shrouded in darkness.

---
## "The Ashen Sage":

- Goddess of knowledge, forgetting, ash, rebirth, sacrifice, mortality, alchemy, wisdom, learning, and teaching.

Smiths and craftsmen invoke his mastery over fire, viewing their work as a form of purification and creation.
- Symbol: A flaming sword.

---
## "The Wandering Tide":
- Goddess of change, evolution, mutation, fluidity, unpredictability, craftsmanship, oceans, tides, personal growth.
