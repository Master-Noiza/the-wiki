# The Nine
---

The gods in this world are rarely altruistic (except for the "Benevolent Stranger" and his motives might prove to be somewhat questionable aswell) and usually act far removed from the affairs of mortals. Temples and holidays may exist, but should someone have to choose between worship and fear, they would be wise to choose fear. Possibly the gods are even entirely removed, sleeping or dead. 
Whatever the case may be, these gods are the "young" ones, the ones which wrestled control over reality from the primordials in the beginning of time.

## [The Bound One](4.%20The%20Bound%20One.md)

- God of destruction, hatred, chaos, rage, violent ends, natural disasters, war, subjugation.

- Before the time of mortals, even before the gods, the Primordials created reality, the universe, and matter. The Primordials represent chaotic, incomprehensible, vague concepts and aspects of reality and the immaterium. When the still young gods finally grew strong and saw the endless possibilities of the universe, they became greedy, jealous, and filled with fear, sparking an unrelenting, endless, brutal war for supremacy. Eventually, the gods decided to pour all their negative emotions and destructive aspects into one being, a vessel. The son of "She Who Weeps" and the "Burning Judge," young, strong, full of potential, became the weapon that turned the tide of the war. The gods ultimately won, but they were too weak to kill their creation. Instead, they wounded and bound him. To this day, the Bound God sleeps in chains, in agony, full of hatred, eternally struggling, ever ready to break his bonds and annihilate the universe.
- Symbol: Broken chains.
